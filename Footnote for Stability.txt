Assumption 2.2 Continuity of system and cost: the system function, state and input constraint set, cost function are continuous and have zero value when zero.

Assumption 2.3 Properties of constraint sets: The constraint set is closed and the terminal region is compact (closed and bounded), each set contains the origin. If the input constraint set is bounded, then u(x) is compact for all x. This basically assumed that the desired eqauilibrium pair is (x,u)=(0,0)

Definition 2.12 Lyapunov function + Theorem 2.13 Lyapunov stability theorem: If the Lyapunov function exists, stability of a system can be proven

Assumption 2.14 Basic stability assumption: Stability can be proven if there exist a control invarant set and lyapunov decrease within the terminal set

Chapter 2.5.4 Linear systems with control and state constraints: If assumption 2.2, 2.3 and 2.14 are satisfied, and the terminal region Xf contains the origin in its interior, by theorems 2.19(asymptotic stability of the origin) and 2.21(lyapunov function and exponential stability), the origin is exponentially stable in Xn(set of feasible states for optimal control problem at stage N)

==================== Logic for proving stability =====================
Estimate Xf ----> Use Xf to estimate XN ----> Confirm assumption 2.2, 2.3, and 2.14
